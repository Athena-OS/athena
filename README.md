### Why Athena?
* *Pentesting*: Athena can access to [BlackArch repository](https://blackarch.org/tools.html), the **biggest pentesting tool warehouse**.
* *User-oriented*: if Arch is born for experienced users, Athena is conceived for **decreasing complexity** and **improving user experience**.
* *Lightweight*: Athena **optimizes the disk space consumption** by retrieving the tools you need only when you use them. Tools you never use won't be stored and the space is only used for what you really need.
* *Performance*: Athena is based on Arch Linux so it is configured to load the **bare minimum** for its purpose. No useless services, no useless modules consuming your resources.
* *Flexibility*: for its Arch nature, Athena is **flexible** and can easily evolve to the new needs of the users.

<a id="intro"></a>
## üéâ Introduction
Athena is designed from scratch, so already during the development phase useless modules and services have been excluded in order to improve performance and resource consumption. Furthermore, this design approach allowed to review in detailed manner each single package and component to include inside the distribution. It led the OS to build a user-friendly environment, despite based on Arch Linux.

The heritage of Arch Linux impacts positively Athena OS:
* Better performance: pacman is faster than apt 
* Focused: Athena can be developed and maintained down to the smallest detail 
* Much more security tools: Athena can rely on BlackArch repository, that contains much more security tools than APT repositories 
* Freedom: during the installation, you can configure your Athena with any resource or service you need. 
* Documentation: Arch Linux is very well documented on Internet for any need

Athena's environment is based on GNOME Wayland that provide exciting features the user can enjoy!

Let's give a detailed look on Athena! 
<br>
<br>

<a id="requirement"></a>
## ‚öì System Requirements
Recommended system requirements for smooth usage in Athena are:
* 30 GB of hard disk space, SSD preferred
* At least 4GB of RAM
* Processor with at least two cores

<br>

<a id="install"></a>
## üéÅ Installation

Download the latest Athena release .iso file from the related section. According to your need, you can choose to install Athena on your computer natively, or implement it on a Virtual Machine (e.g., VMware or VirtualBox).

Currently VirtualBox is affected by a bug is enabling 3D Acceleration, so keep it disabled.
3D Acceleration also makes intermittent freezes on the environment if enabled on VMware or VirtualBox if you use xorg.
It is strongly suggested to keep it disabled.

When you mount the ISO to your pendrive or your Virtual Machine and boot up Athena, you will meet Athena Calamares Installer, that allows you to customise your future Athena OS as you wish.

<br>

<a id="config"></a>
## üìê Configuration

### Latest Release
After the installation and the first boot:
* open Athena Welcome, clck on `HTB Update` and copy and paste your Hack The Box API key.

The Hack The Box API Key can be retrieved by your Hack The Box profile settings -> "Create App Token".

Remember to update Hack The Box machines by the `HTB Update` button periodically.

## ‚ùì Support
If you detect any issues during your experience, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Athena-OS/athena-iso/issues/new/choose) on athena-iso GitHub repository. Current troubleshooting:
* After the first login of Discord App, at the next access on the application, if it freezes during the starting, reboot the system and the issue will be fixed.
* During the installation or usage, if you are getting issues related to the blackarch.db retrieving packages or keys, check for any firewall your traffic is routed through and whitelist `blackarch.org`.
* AkameGaKill theme cannot apply red theme for legacy windows due to GTK 4.0 files missing.
* On Bloodhound, when neo4j database is run by `sudo neo4j console`, we can get some errors like:
  ```
  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.LinkageError: Cannot to link java.nio.DirectByteBuffer
  ```
  For solving it, just run neo4j server by `systemctl start neo4j`. You can check the proof that the server is correctly running by `systemctl status neo4j`.
