Firecat
Copyright (C) 2008-2011 Stach & Liu LLC
Firecat allows you to punch reverse TCP tunnels out of a compromised host,
enabling you to connect to arbitrary host/ports on the target network regardless of ingress firewall rules.
It incorporates code from netcat for Windows, specifically the "-e" command execution code.
