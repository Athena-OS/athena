.SH DESCRIPTION
Because of cpu aliasing problems, there are a lot of problems with stalled pipelines. A famous problem is at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8547778/why-is-one-loop-so-much-slower-than-two-loops
.TP
This library tries to intercept the memory allocations to skew the allocations to different offsets, so the performance penalty to disappear.
.TP
Applications that process a lot of data in big memory allocations will benefit from this application without recompiling the sources (if available).

.SH HOW IT WORKS
cpublaster is a shared object that hooks memory allocation functions and add an small offset to them.
.TP
Fine tuning can be done using environment variables described below.
.SH EXAMPLES
0. Output debug stuff in a log file (for debugging):
.TP
\fB	export CPUBLASTER_VERBOSE=999
.TP
\fB	export CPUBLASTER_LOG="xxx.log"
.TP
\fB	your_program_here

1. verbose operations:
.TP
\fB	export CPUBLASTER_VERBOSE=999
.TP
\fB	export CPUBLASTER_LOG="xxx.log"
.TP
\fB	export CPUBLASTER_MINIM_ALLOCATION=128
.TP
\fB	export CPUBLASTER_INCREMENT=128
