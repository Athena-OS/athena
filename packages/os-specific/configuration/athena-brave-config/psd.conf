# Uncomment and set to "yes" to use overlayfs instead of a full copy to reduce
# the memory costs and to improve sync/unsync operations. Note that your kernel
# MUST have this module available in order to use this mode.
#
USE_OVERLAYFS="yes"

# Uncomment and set to "yes" to resync on suspend to reduce potential data loss.
# Note that your system MUST have gdbus from glib2 installed to use this mode.

# Uncomment and set to "no" to completely disable the crash recovery feature.
#
# The default is to create crash recovery backups if the system is ungracefully
# powered-down due to a kernel panic, hitting the reset switch, battery going
# dead, etc. Some users keep very diligent backups and don't care to have this
# feature enabled.
#USE_BACKUPS="yes"

# Uncomment and set to an integer that is the maximum number of crash recovery
# snapshots to keep (the oldest ones are deleted first).
#
# The default is to save the most recent 5 crash recovery snapshots.
