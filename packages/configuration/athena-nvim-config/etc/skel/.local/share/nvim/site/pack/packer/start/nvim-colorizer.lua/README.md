# colorizer.lua

[![luadoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/luadoc-0.1-blue)](https://nvchad.com/nvim-colorizer.lua/)

A high-performance color highlighter for Neovim which has **no external dependencies**! Written in performant Luajit.

![Demo.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/norcalli/github-assets/master/nvim-colorizer.lua-demo-short.gif)

## Installation and Usage

Requires Neovim >= 0.7.0 and `set termguicolors`.
If you don't have true color for your terminal or are
unsure, [read this excellent guide](https://github.com/termstandard/colors).

Use your plugin manager or clone directly into your package.

```lua
use 'NvChad/nvim-colorizer.lua'
```

As long as you have `malloc()` and `free()` on your system, this will work.
Which includes Linux, OSX, and Windows.

One line setup. This will create an `autocmd` for `FileType *` to highlight
every filetype.

**NOTE**: You should add this line after/below where your plugins are setup.

```lua
require 'colorizer'.setup()
```

### Use with commands

| Command  | Description  |
|---|---|
| **ColorizerAttachToBuffer**  | Attach to the current buffer with given or default settings  |
| **ColorizerDetachFromBuffer**  | Stop highlighting the current buffer |
| **ColorizerReloadAllBuffers**  | Reload all buffers that are being highlighted currently |
| **ColorizerToggle**  | Toggle highlighting of the current buffer  |

### Use from lua

```lua

-- All options that can be passed to `user_default_options` in setup() can be passed here
-- Similar for other functions

-- Attach to buffer
require("colorizer").attach_to_buffer(0, { mode = "background", css = true})

-- Detach from buffer
require("colorizer").detach_from_buffer(0, { mode = "virtualtext", css = true})

```
## Why another highlighter?

Mostly, **RAW SPEED**.

This has no external dependencies, which means you install it and **it just
works**. Other colorizers typically were synchronous and slow, as well. Being
written with performance in mind and leveraging the excellent LuaJIT and a
handwritten parser, updates can be done in real time. There are plugins such as
[hexokinase](https://github.com/RRethy/vim-hexokinase) which have good
performance, but it has some difficulty with becoming out of sync. The downside
is that _this only works for Neovim_, and that will never change.

Apart from that, it only applies the highlights to the current visible contents, so
even if a big file is opened, the editor won't just choke on a blank screen.

This idea was copied from
 [brenoprata10/nvim-highlight-colors](https://github.com/brenoprata10/nvim-highlight-colors)

Additionally, having a Lua API that's available means users can use this as a
library to do custom highlighting themselves.

## Customization

**Note**: These are the default options

```lua
  require("colorizer").setup {
      filetypes = { "*" },
      user_default_options = {
        RGB = true, -- #RGB hex codes
        RRGGBB = true, -- #RRGGBB hex codes
        names = true, -- "Name" codes like Blue or blue
        RRGGBBAA = false, -- #RRGGBBAA hex codes
        AARRGGBB = false, -- 0xAARRGGBB hex codes
        rgb_fn = false, -- CSS rgb() and rgba() functions
        hsl_fn = false, -- CSS hsl() and hsla() functions
        css = false, -- Enable all CSS features: rgb_fn, hsl_fn, names, RGB, RRGGBB
        css_fn = false, -- Enable all CSS *functions*: rgb_fn, hsl_fn
        -- Available modes for `mode`: foreground, background,  virtualtext
        mode = "background", -- Set the display mode.
        -- Available methods are false / true / "normal" / "lsp" / "both"
        -- True is same as normal
        tailwind = false, -- Enable tailwind colors
        -- parsers can contain values used in |user_default_options|
        sass = { enable = false, parsers = { css }, }, -- Enable sass colors
        virtualtext = "â– ",
      },
      -- all the sub-options of filetypes apply to buftypes
      buftypes = {},
  }
```

MODES:

- `foreground`: sets the foreground text color.
- `background`: sets the background text color.
- `virtualtext`: indicate the color behind the virtualtext.

For basic setup, you can use a command like the following.

```lua
-- Attaches to every FileType mode
require 'colorizer'.setup()

-- Attach to certain Filetypes, add special configuration for `html`
-- Use `background` for everything else.
require 'colorizer'.setup {
  filetypes = {
    'css',
    'javascript',
    html = { mode = 'foreground'; }
  },
}

-- Use the `default_options` as the second parameter, which uses
-- `foreground` for every mode. This is the inverse of the previous
-- setup configuration.
require 'colorizer'.setup {
  filetypes = {
    'css',
    'javascript',
    html = { mode = 'foreground'; }
  },
  user_default_options = { mode = "background", },
}

-- Use the `default_options` as the second parameter, which uses
-- `foreground` for every mode. This is the inverse of the previous
-- setup configuration.
require 'colorizer'.setup {
  filetypes = {
    '*'; -- Highlight all files, but customize some others.
    css = { rgb_fn = true; }; -- Enable parsing rgb(...) functions in css.
    html = { names = false; } -- Disable parsing "names" like Blue or Gray
  },
}

-- Exclude some filetypes from highlighting by using `!`
require 'colorizer'.setup {
  filetypes = {
    '*'; -- Highlight all files, but customize some others.
    '!vim'; -- Exclude vim from highlighting.
  -- Exclusion Only makes sense if '*' is specified!
  },
}

```

All the above examples can also be apply to buftypes. Also no buftypes trigger colorizer by default

Buftype value is fetched by `vim.bo.buftype`

```lua
-- need to specify buftypes
require 'colorizer'.setup(
  buftypes = {
      "*",
      -- exclude prompt and popup buftypes from highlight
      "!prompt",
      "!popup",
    }
)
```

For lower level interface, see the [LuaDocs for API details](https://nvchad.com/nvim-colorizer.lua/modules/colorizer.html) or use `:h colorizer` once installed.

Documentaion is generated using ldoc. See
[scripts/gen_docs.sh](https://github.com/NvChad/nvim-colorizer.lua/blob/master/scripts/gen_docs.sh)

## TODO

- [ ] Add more colour types ( var, advanced css functions )
- [ ] Add more display modes. E.g - sign column
- [ ] Use a more space efficient trie implementation.
